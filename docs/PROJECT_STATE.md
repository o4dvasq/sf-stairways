# Project State — sf-stairways

_Last updated: 2026-03-29 (neighborhood-map-and-detail)_

## Platforms

### iOS App (primary)
- Swift/SwiftUI/iOS 17+ with Map, List, Stats, and **Search** tabs
- SwiftData + CloudKit — container init with CloudKit configured; falls back to local-only with detailed error logging if CloudKit fails
- `SyncStatusManager` tracks live CloudKit event notifications; cloud icon in Stats tab shows sync state
- Supabase SDK integrated; `AuthManager` manages Sign in with Apple session
- Photo capture with thumbnails, location services, seed data import
- Tags are **read-only** on iOS (display + filter only) — all tag CRUD is macOS-only; `TagEditorSheet` removed
- `StairwayStore` filters out deleted stairways via `applyDeletions(_:)` — map, list, search, progress all respect deletions
- **Visual design: light-first** — warm terracotta `brandOrange`, SF Pro Rounded for display text, `surfaceCardElevated` stat cards, orange progress ring
- **Neighborhoods: SF 311 Neighborhoods** — 117 granular neighborhoods (as defined by Mayor's Office of Neighborhood Services, 2006), 68 with stairways; powered by `NeighborhoodStore` (GeoJSON-backed, computes centroids + adjacency at startup); property key `name`
- Successfully archived in Xcode on 2026-03-23
- See `docs/IOS_REFERENCE.md` for full build details

### iOS Admin App (`SFStairwaysAdmin`)
- **`ios/SFStairwaysAdmin/`** — separate iOS target in `SFStairways.xcodeproj`, bundle ID `com.o4dvasq.SFStairways.admin`
- Shares the same CloudKit container (`iCloud.com.o4dvasq.sfstairways`) — all override, tag, and deletion changes sync automatically
- Shares SwiftData model files with both iOS and macOS targets
- **No map, no photo management, no HealthKit, no Supabase** — utility-only tool
- `AdminBrowser` — searchable list of all stairways; filter chips (All/Walked/Unwalked/Has Override/Has Issues); sort by Name/Neighborhood/Date Walked; row indicators for walked status, override, tag count; toolbar: Tag Manager + Removed Stairways buttons
- `AdminDetailView` — push-navigation detail: catalog data (read-only), walk data (read-only), editable overrides (step count, height, description) with Save/Cancel, tag chips with add/remove, "Remove Stairway" destructive action with reason field
- `AdminTagManager` — modal sheet: preset tags read-only with counts, custom tags with inline rename and delete (cascade confirmation), create new tag
- `RemovedStairwaysView` — modal sheet: list of `StairwayDeletion` records with name/date/reason; swipe to restore

### macOS Admin Dashboard
- **`ios/SFStairwaysMac/`** — macOS target in `SFStairways.xcodeproj`, bundle ID `com.o4dvasq.SFStairways.mac`
- Shares the same CloudKit container as iOS — all walk data, overrides, tags, deletions sync automatically
- Shares SwiftData model files with iOS (same `Models/*.swift`)
- Three-column `NavigationSplitView`: sidebar (neighborhoods + tags filter) → sortable stairway table → detail panel
- **Deletion filtering**: `StairwayBrowser` queries `StairwayDeletion` records and excludes matching stairways from the table
- **Sidebar Tags section**: lists tags with assignment counts; clicking a tag filters table; intersects with neighborhood filter
- **Table sorting**: all numeric columns sortable with nil-last logic via `nilLastSorted` helper
- **TagManagerSheet**: full tag CRUD — create custom tags, inline rename, delete with cascade confirmation, preset tags read-only
- Detail panel: catalog vs. walk data comparison, editable curator overrides, notes editing, tag add/remove + "Create & Assign…" option, photo grid with delete + Add Photos
- Bulk Operations: bulk tag assign + "Create new tag…" + "Remove Tag from All Selected," bulk mark walked, CSV export
- Data Hygiene sheet: flags missing height, missing coordinates, no HealthKit data, promotion candidates, proximity unverified
- **App icon**: white StairShape silhouette on brandOrange background
- **Acknowledgements**: `info.circle` toolbar button opens `AcknowledgementsSheet`
- No Supabase, no HealthKit fetching on macOS (displays synced walk data only)

### Web App (deprecated)
- `index.html` remains in the repo for historical reference
- No further development — see DECISIONS.md for rationale

## Current Data

| SF 311 Neighborhoods | **117** total, **68** with stairways |

## Recent Completions

### 2026-03-29 (this session)
- **Neighborhood Map Overlays + Detail View** — `MapPolygon` overlays for all 117 neighborhoods with warm-toned pastel fills (light: 17% alpha, dark: 11%); centroid label annotations visible at mapSpan < 0.04 degrees (~5–7 neighborhoods visible); Around Me dimming applied to polygon opacity (3% when dimmed); label tap → `NeighborhoodDetail` sheet; `NeighborhoodDetail` view: navigation title, progress bar (walked/total), embedded 200pt map (neighborhood polygon + stairway pins), horizontal photo scroll (hidden if none), stairway list (walked first by date desc, then unwalked alphabetical); 4 navigation entry points: map label, ListTab section header (NavigationLink push), SearchPanel neighborhood tab (NavigationLink push, replaces fly-to-map), StairwayBottomSheet neighborhood name (tappable chevron link, opens sheet); `Views/Neighborhood/NeighborhoodDetail.swift` created; `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup` auto-picks up new file.
- **Neighborhood 311 Migration** — Replaced DataSF Analysis Neighborhoods GeoJSON (41 hoods) with SF 311 Neighborhoods dataset (117 hoods, granular locally-recognized names); `sf_neighborhoods.geojson` swapped in Resources; `NeighborhoodStore` updated to read `name` property (was `nhood`); color palette expanded from 8→12 colors for better coverage across 68 active neighborhoods; `all_stairways.json` re-migrated (367 point-in-polygon, 15 manual by stairway ID, 0 centroid fallbacks); `target_list.json` re-migrated (13/13 PIP); Forest Hill, Corona Heights, Diamond Heights, Eureka Valley, Clarendon Heights, Dolores Heights all now exist as separate neighborhoods with stairways assigned.
- **Neighborhood Foundation** — `Neighborhood` struct + `NeighborhoodStore` (`@Observable`) replace two separate static JSON files; GeoJSON-backed (`sf_neighborhoods.geojson`, 41 DataSF Analysis Neighborhoods); centroids computed from polygon geometry at startup; adjacency computed from shared polygon vertex proximity (grid-bucketed, ~100m threshold); `AroundMeManager` refactored to accept `NeighborhoodStore` at activation call site instead of init; `SFStairwaysApp` initializes and injects `NeighborhoodStore` into SwiftUI environment; `MapTab` reads from environment; `all_stairways.json` migrated from 53 scraped names → 41 DataSF names (367 point-in-polygon, 15 manual mapping, 0 unassigned); "Mission Distrtict" typo eliminated; `neighborhood_centroids.json` and `neighborhood_adjacency.json` deleted.

### 2026-03-29 (earlier sessions)
- **iOS Admin App** — new iOS target `SFStairwaysAdmin` (bundle: `com.o4dvasq.SFStairways.admin`); shares CloudKit container and all SwiftData models; `AdminBrowser` with search/filter/sort, `AdminDetailView` with editable overrides + tag management + stairway removal, `AdminTagManager` CRUD sheet, `RemovedStairwaysView` for restore flow; `StairwayDeletion` model added to all three targets' ModelContainer schemas; `StairwayStore.applyDeletions()` filters deleted IDs from `stairways` computed property; main iOS app, macOS app, and admin app all respect deletions.
- **HealthKit diagnostics** — added debug logging and 1-second post-walk delay in `HealthKitService.fetchWalkStats` to allow HealthKit time to flush walk data before querying; toast on nil stats result.
- **Visual refresh phase 1** — light mode as default appearance; warm terracotta `brandOrange`; six new adaptive surface/text tokens; progress ring stroke changed to `brandOrange`; SF Pro Rounded on all display numbers; splash screen background changed to `brandOrange`.
- **Map label cleanup** — `Stairway.displayName` truncates to first 4 words; labels hidden at `mapSpan > 0.02`.
- **UX fixes round 3** — `forestGreen` brightened; notes Save button only; collapsible neighborhood `DisclosureGroup` in Stats; Search as 4th tab; `NavigationCoordinator` for cross-tab navigation.
- **Attribution & acknowledgements** — "View on Urban Hiker SF Map" link; iOS Settings Acknowledgements section; macOS `AcknowledgementsSheet`.
- **macOS tag management** — `TagManagerSheet` CRUD; sidebar Tags filter; nil-last table sorting; iOS tags read-only; macOS app icon.
- **Urban Hiker SF data import**, **macOS photo add + notes editing**, **HealthKit data accuracy fix**, **macOS Admin Dashboard**, **Photo sync fix**, **Map launch cleanup**.

### 2026-03-28

- See: `docs/specs/implemented/` for full spec history

## Pending Specs

- `docs/specs/SPEC_neighborhood-311-migration.md`
- `docs/specs/SPEC_neighborhood-progress-reframe.md`

## Known Issues

- **macOS CloudKit sync:** first launch on Mac requires a few minutes for CloudKit to sync iOS walk data down.
- **HealthKit:** entitlement added to `.entitlements`; HealthKit capability must also be manually enabled in Xcode target Signing & Capabilities.
- **CloudKit sync:** may fall back to local if Xcode target lacks Background Modes → Remote Notifications capability (manual Xcode step).
- **CKErrorDomain error 2** (not authenticated) surfaces as red error icon on Stats tab — requires CloudKit investigation.
- **supabase-swift** package not confirmed added to Xcode target membership.
- **Sign in with Apple:** `signInError` display is temporary for debugging.
- **Supabase Apple provider** config not yet manually verified.
- **Admin app Xcode target**: file memberships and capabilities must be manually verified in Xcode after pulling — the target config is in `project.pbxproj` but CloudKit + Background Modes capabilities require Signing & Capabilities UI.
